# Angular extract i18n and merge

This extends Angular CLI to improve the i18n extraction and merge workflow. New/removed translations are added/removed
from the target translation files. Additionally, translation files are normalized (pretty print, sorted by id) so that
diffs are easy to read (and translations in PRs might actually get reviewed ;-) ).

## Install

_Prerequisites_: i18n setup with defined target locales in `angular.json` - as
documented [here](https://angular.io/guide/i18n-common-merge).

```shell
ng add ng-extract-i18n-merge
```

### Upgrade from 1.x.x to 2.0.0

To upgrade use `ng update ng-extract-i18n-merge` - this will perform all necessary migrations.

Breaking changes:

* Now this plugin uses the default angular "extract-i18n" target - so you can (must) simply run `ng extract-i18n`! (#30)
* Default sort is now "stableAppendNew" (was: "idAsc") (#26).
* Leading/trailing whitespaces are normalized (i.e. collapsed to one space) but not completely trimmed (#28).
* Npm run script is removed (you can create a manual npm run script of course).

## Usage

```shell
ng extract-i18n # yes, same as before - this replaces the original builder
```

### Configuration

In your `angular.json` the target `extract-i18n` that can be configured with the following options:

| Name                         | Default                                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
